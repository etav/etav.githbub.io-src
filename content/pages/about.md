I am an aspiring data scientist with a passion for technology startups—I
     hope to one day found an AI/Machine Learning venture in Silicon Valley.

 Currently I work at SocialCode as an Advertising Manager but prior to
 that I was a student at UPenn where I became the first person in my
 family to earn a college degree (B.S. in Economics) with a triple concentration in
 Analytics, Marketing and Entrepreneurship from The Wharton
 School.

 I never considered myself a "quant" but during my time at Penn I challenged
 myself by taking as many statistics classes as my major would allow and fell in love with the subject.
 I also interned at 3 Philadelphia startups and [DreamIt Ventures](http://www.dreamit.com/) before co-founding
 a startup incubator,[WeissLabs](https://weisslabs.io)during my final year.

 My first exposure to coding was R but currently I'm learning Python.
